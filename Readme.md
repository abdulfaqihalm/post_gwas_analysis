# Post GWAS Analysis of T2D Related Traits

This project was intened to do joint analysis of T2D-related traits in the hope that we can find a new interestin loci due to the increament of power after the joining process. In this project I used [MTAR package](https://github.com/baolinwu/MTAR/tree/0e170a15a0b78d589e4c057ee866c82f1510fad8). In this repo, I only put three GWAS sources for the analysis which are: T2D (From DIAMANTE), ALP (GCST90013406) and ALT (GCST90013405).
